Logfile parser for P1999.
Currently, is able to monitor logfiles in the target directory, and identify lines of interest, parse those lines to obtain meaningful information from them such as name of the spell being cast, name of who it's being cast on, and so on. Then it will manage a GUI using that information.

I would like to develop more features later, but for now it only identifies spells, who you cast them on, and their duration.
